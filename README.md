# zcoop98's Userscripts

This repository holds a collection of userscripts I've written over time.

Most will likely be for the Stack Exchange network of sites, but others may appear here likewise.

## Stack Exchange Scripts

### [Invert Staff & Mod Label Colors](https://github.com/zcoop98/Userscripts/blob/master/StackExchange/SE_InvertModStaffBadges.user.js)

Flips the color fill of the original updated designs of the staff and moderator badges on Stack Exchange sites, and replaces the SVG diamond with the "â™¦" character.

| Modified | Original Default | Current Default |
|---------|---------|---------|

This makes them much less distracting on the page, yet still distinctive.
