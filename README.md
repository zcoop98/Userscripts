# zcoop98's Userscripts

This repository holds a collection of userscripts I've written over time.

Most will likely be for the Stack Exchange network of sites, but others may appear here likewise.

## Stack Exchange Scripts

### [Invert Staff & Mod Label Colors](https://github.com/zcoop98/Userscripts/blob/master/StackExchange/SE_InvertModStaffBadges.user.js)

Flips the color fill of staff and moderator badges on Stack Exchange sites, and replaces the SVG diamond with the "â™¦" character.

| Modified | Default |
|---------|---------|
| ![Modified moderator and staff badges with solid edges but transparent fill and smaller, pointed diamond](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8434006/127709892-5488dacc-4dc2-406d-9392-530f2720b406.png) | ![Default moderator and staff badge with solid color fill and large rounded diamond](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8434006/127709883-3b398e5e-dd57-4652-a610-facbb271ea3b.png) |

This makes them much less distracting on the page, yet still distinctive.
